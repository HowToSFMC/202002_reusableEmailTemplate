# howToSFMC Reuseable Email Template Submission
Description - This is a dynamic modular template with a google sheet content management system. The template can be loaded into SFMC along with content blocks and then a call can be made using json exported from the google sheet to a DE that will edit the contents and styles defined in the CMS for that specific template key/or subscriber. For this build the data is normalized in the google doc so that it is ready for import into the DE controlling the styles and content for the email specified.

Very few ampscript functions were used as the data was massaged prior to entry into SFMC.
